## Chapter 1 - Building Abstractions with Procedures
- Going to study computational process
- Processes manipulate other abstract things called data
- A process is directed by a pattern of rules called a program

### 1.1 - The Elements of Programming
- Every language has three mechanisms for combining simple ideas into more complex ideas
  - Primitive expressions: simplest entities the languge is concerned with
  - Means of combination: by which compound elements are built from simpler ones
  - Means of abstraction: by which compound elements can be named and manipulated as units
